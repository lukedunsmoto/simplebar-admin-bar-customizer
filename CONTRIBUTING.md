## Development Guidelines

- Follow WordPress coding standards where practical
- Avoid introducing new dependencies unless strictly necessary

SimpleBar aims to remain lightweight and easy to understand.

---

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

- Explain *why* the change is needed
- Avoid combining unrelated changes
- Update documentation where relevant

Not every idea will be merged — that’s not a reflection on quality, just on scope.

## Philosophy

SimpleBar exists to make the WordPress admin bar calmer and more intentional.

If a proposed change makes the plugin:

- More complex to configure
- Less focused

…it probably doesn’t belong here.

Thanks for helping keep SimpleBar simple.
