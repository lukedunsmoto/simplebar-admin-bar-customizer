## Why SimpleBar?

The WordPress admin bar is powerful — but it gets cluttered quickly.  
SimpleBar exists to make it calmer, clearer, and more intentional.

No bloated settings screens.  
No feature creep.  
No dark patterns or upsells.

Just a focused tool that lets you hide what you don’t need and keep your workflow tidy.
