Customise the Admin Bar and Admin Menu colours.
Per‑role: hide core items, add custom links, and reorder (best‑effort).

== Description ==
SimpleBar gives you:
* Colours for Admin Bar (front‑end & admin) and the left Admin Menu.
* Per‑role controls: hide common core nodes, add custom links with drag & drop order, and optional preferred order of top‑level items.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` or install the ZIP.
2. Activate in **Plugins**.
3. Go to **Settings → SimpleBar**.
4. Use **Appearance** for colours. Use **Roles & Links** for role‑specific settings.

== Notes ==
* Reordering is best‑effort. WordPress and plugins may add nodes after our hook runs.

== Changelog ==
= 2.0.0 =
Rebuild with role‑based links + colours.
